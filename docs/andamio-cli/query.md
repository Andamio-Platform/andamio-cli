### Synopsis


The Andamio Network is home to valuable, public data that becomes even 
more valuable when you have tools to make sense of it. Andamio CLI gives 
developers instant access to helpful queries that allow users to gain 
insights about the network. In this phase of Andamio CLI development, we 
will focus on making it easy for anyone to make useful queries to the 
Andamio network.

The queries provided here serve two purposes:
 1. Opening access to Andamio network data
 2. Providing examples for Cardano Go Project-Based Learning Course
